# Project Overview
Homeowners currently face a tedious and time-consuming process when trying to find contractors for home renovations. The process of selecting a contractor is typically time-consuming and complicated, involving scattered information on pricing, quality of work, and project management. There is no centralised platform to easily identify potential contractors. Most rely on Google searches, which yield scattered and incomplete information, or visit the HDB website to browse a list of approved contractors. However, even with this resource, they are often left in the same situation—having to sift through a large pool of contractors and conduct further research to make informed decisions.

In addition to online searches, many homeowners turn to word-of-mouth recommendations from friends or relatives. While this can be helpful, it presents its own challenges. Renovation is often a one-time activity, and what works well for someone else might not suit their specific needs or preferences. This leaves homeowners with no guarantee of the same success, further complicating the process and adding to their stress.

## How would our web app solve the problem?
The application would provide greater transparency through expanding avenues of communication between the clients and the contractors, allowing for a more efficient renovation process. Consolidating contractor information also helps to facilitate homeowners in finding the relevant information that they require, and alleviates any concerns regarding the trustworthiness of the contractors.
